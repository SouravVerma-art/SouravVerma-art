✨ Hi, I'm Sourav Verma — a highly motivated engineering student passionate about building scalable software, intelligent systems, and impactful digital products. I am currently working on AI-driven projects such as **Omnex (a Perplexity-style AI platform)** while strengthening my expertise in **React, Next.js, backend development, and data-driven problem solving**. I actively practice **Data Structures & Algorithms** to improve my logical thinking, coding efficiency, and interview readiness. I enjoy collaborating on **open-source projects** focused on web platforms, automation tools, developer productivity, and beginner-friendly communities, and I continuously seek mentorship and feedback to improve my engineering maturity, system design understanding, and production-level coding practices.  

🌱 My learning journey includes mastering **C++, Git & GitHub workflows, ethical hacking fundamentals, Linux environments, database systems, and modern frontend frameworks**, along with sharpening my **English communication and technical documentation skills**. I love exploring how software can solve real-world problems efficiently and securely. You can ask me about **C programming, JavaScript fundamentals, React concepts, API integration, Git collaboration, debugging strategies, and engineering study techniques**. ⚡ Fun fact: I believe in daily consistency — small improvements every day compound into massive growth, and my long-term vision is to become a world-class software engineer and contribute to impactful technology at Microsoft 🚀
